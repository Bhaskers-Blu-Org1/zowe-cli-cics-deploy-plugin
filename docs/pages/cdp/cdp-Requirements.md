### z/OS Management Facility
A [z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.izua300/IZUHPINFO_PartConfiguring.htm) server is required to run the [push bundle](Commands#command-push-bundle), [deploy bundle](Commands#command-deploy-bundle), and [undeploy bundle](Commands#command-undeploy-bundle) commands. These commands call the API for [`zowe zos-jobs submit`](https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/latest/user-guide/cli-usingcli.html#zos-jobs) to submit JCL that executes the DFHDPLOY utility to deploy and undeploy CICS bundles.

The z/OSMF server is also required by the [push bundle](Commands#command-push-bundle) command when it uses the API for [`zowe files upload dir-to-uss`](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/207) to copy a CICS bundle to a z/OS directory.

### z/OS Secure SHell daemon
The [z/OS Secure SHell daemon (sshd)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.foto100/sshset.htm) is required to run the [push bundle](Commands#command-push-bundle) command. This command uses the API for [`zowe zos-uss issue ssh`](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/308) to remove old files from the CICS bundle directory on z/OS and execute `npm install` on z/OS to install dependencies for Node.js applications.

### DFHDPLOY utility
The [DFHDPLOY](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.5.0/applications/deploying/dfhdploy_overview.html) utility is provided with IBM CICS Transaction Server (CICS) and is required to run the [push bundle](Commands#command-push-bundle), [deploy bundle](Commands#command-deploy-bundle), and [undeploy bundle](Commands#command-undeploy-bundle) commands. These commands start DFHDPLOY with a script to perform deploy and undeploy operations. For example the deploy operation will define, install, then enable a CICS BUNDLE resource in a one or more CICS regions.

The DFHDPLOY utility requires CICSPlex System Manager \(CPSM\) that is also provided with CICS to be configured, and for CPSM to be connected to the target CICS regions.

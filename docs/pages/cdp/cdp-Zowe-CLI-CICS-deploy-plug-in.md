The cics-deploy plug-in provides a CICS® deployment workflow for developers and CI/CD automation pipelines similar to that experienced when deploying applications to cloud environments.

Before you start, and especially if you are not familiar with the world of z/OS, Zowe, and CICS, it's a good idea to read about some of the key concepts, which include [Zowe](cdp-Zowe-and-CLI), [Zowe CLI profiles](cdp-Zowe-CLI-profiles) and [CICS® bundles](cdp-CICS-bundles). If you're keen to get going quickly, you can jump right in and follow along with our tutorial on [Deploying a Node.js application](cdp-Deploying-a-Nodejs-application).

When everything is [installed](cdp-Installing) and you have [created the Zowe CLI profiles](cdp-Creating-Zowe-CLI-profiles), you can deploy an application from your workstation to CICS® in two steps:

1. Use the [zowe cics-deploy generate bundle](cdp-CLIReadMe#generate--g--gen) command to generate some metadata and artifacts that help the target CICS® system understand your application.

2. Use the [zowe cics-deploy push bundle](cdp-CLIReadMe#push--p) command to push the generated bundle to one or more regions within a CICSplex®, enabling and deploying it as an executing application. 

Should you need it, and if you understand a little more about CICS®, further commands like [zowe cics-deploy deploy bundle](cdp-CLIReadMe#deploy--d--dep) and [zowe cics-deploy undeploy bundle](cdp-CLIReadMe#undeploy--u--udep) offer you finer-grained control of the process - for example, to enable you to install a bundle in subsets of CICS® regions in a cluster in such a way as to maintain an application's availability for clients.

# zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin
This project aims to create a plugin for Zowe CLI https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli.  The plugin will provide the capability to deploy applications developed on a workstation to IBM CICS, as CICS bundles. Initially it will support deploying Node.js applications.  It aims to provide an experience similar to deploying to a cloud platform when deploying to CICS.  It will also provide low-level commands for performing individual pieces of the deployment process that could be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
